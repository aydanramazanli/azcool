If you have a bad one, though, you\u2019re going to be noticing it all the time \u2013 and not in a good way. Having reliable hot water isn\u2019t just a convenience issue. It\u2019s also something you need to make sure you can keep your home clean and safe for your family.<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons, picking out a good hot water heater for your home in the Baltimore\u00a0area is an important process that you\u2019ll have to take pretty seriously. Even if you want to, though, this can be tough because there simply are a lot of elements that go into making this decision that you\u2019re probably not overly familiar with. After all, how often do you really purchase a hot water heater?<\/p>\n<p>Because this is such an important but difficult decision, it can be very helpful to get some professional advice as you work your way through it. For just that type of guidance and service, Quality Refrigeration Services\u00a0is your best bet. While you don\u2019t spend much time thinking about hot water heaters, we do, and so we know just how to find the right product to match your needs.<\/p>\n<h2>Water Heater Tip<\/h2>\n<p>Keep an eye out for water heater deterioration because leaks can develop slowly over time and lead to flooding in your garage or basement. Please keep in mind that water heaters are designed to be installed vertically, so if a water heater is installed horizontally the chances that it will develop leaks increases. Schedule regular water heater maintenance visits to avoid many of these issues.<\/p>\n<h2>Choosing a Water Heater<\/h2>\n<p>The type of water heater that\u2019s best for you will depend on several things. For instance, you\u2019ll need a product that\u2019s big enough to handle all of your home hot water needs. You don\u2019t want to wind up with a hot water heater that\u2019s too small, so that you\u2019re constantly running out of hot water. But, of course, the bigger the hot water heater is, the more expensive it will be to purchase and to run, so you don\u2019t want to get one that\u2019s bigger than necessary either.<\/p>\n<p>So in this equation, size is definitely important. However, that\u2019s not the only thing you\u2019ll have to take into consideration. You also need to decide what type of fuel you\u2019d like your hot water heater to run on. That decision is usually at least partially aided by what\u2019s available and the relative costs of each type of energy supply in the area in which you live.<\/p>\n<h2>Tank Water Heaters vs. Tankless Hot Water Heaters<\/h2>\n<p>Another significant element to consider is whether you want a water heater with a tank or a tankless one. Tankless water heaters are rapidly growing in popularity, largely because of their energy efficiency. To a great extent, this added efficiency comes from the fact that they don\u2019t hold hot water in reserve like traditional tank water heaters do.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, tankless water heaters heat the water rapidly by running it through a set of heating elements once you turn on the tap. This doesn\u2019t cause much of a delay in getting the hot water to you and means that you don\u2019t have to pay to keep that tank of hot water sitting there until you need to use it. However, tankless hot water heaters may have trouble keeping up with the demands of a large household where multiple people may be trying to use the hot water at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Traditional tank water heaters do require energy to keep the water in reserve hot the entire time, whether you\u2019re using it or not. They also take up more space than a tankless model. But if they\u2019re big enough, they can handle a large and diverse hot water demand at once, so if you have a large household, this may be something you should take into account.<\/p>\n<h2>Our Water Heater Services<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking for water heater installation, maintenance or repair in the Baltimore area, this is the place to come.
