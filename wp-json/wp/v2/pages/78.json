While the main work is typically done by professional heating technicians, the hardest part for you may very well be making sure that you\u2019ve picked out the right system for your home in the \u00a0area. This is often easier said than done, due to the number of factors you\u2019ll need to take into account when you\u2019re making your selection.<\/p>\n<p>If you feel like you don\u2019t even know where to begin this process, give us a call today. Our heating experts will walk you through the selection process and help you pick out a system that\u2019s appropriate for the dimensions of your house and the specific heating needs of your family.<\/p>\n<h2>Electric Furnaces<\/h2>\n<p>An electric furnace is a good option to consider when you\u2019re looking at new heating systems for your home. These furnaces run extremely quietly and since they don\u2019t use gas or oil for fuel, there\u2019s a reduced risk of fire associated with them. Electric furnaces are also a bit cheaper to maintain, as they don\u2019t require tune-ups as often as some other similar products. However, you will still have to keep to a regular schedule of professional maintenance if you want to make sure your furnace continues to work well for many years to come.<\/p>\n<h2>Gas Furnaces<\/h2>\n<p>Despite some of the attractive features of electric furnaces, gas furnaces are still the more popular of the two. They tend to be more energy efficient than electric models, and as long as they\u2019re properly maintained, gas furnaces are perfectly safe to have and operate in your home.<\/p>\n<p>A gas furnace will also typically cost less to install than an electric one, but they do require more frequent maintenance than most electric models. Also, although some older gas furnaces could be quite noisy when they were running, today\u2019s models are almost as quiet as their electric counterparts.<\/p>\n<h2>AFUE Ratings for Furnaces<\/h2>\n<p>One thing you\u2019ll notice when you\u2019re comparing various types of furnaces is that they all come with what\u2019s called an AFUE rating. This number reflects the energy efficiency of that particular model, so it\u2019s important to take into account when you\u2019re making your selection.<\/p>\n<p>The furnaces on the market today typically have an AFUE rating of 80% or higher. Some can even get up above 90%, and while more efficient is generally better, there are other things you should take into account as well. For instance, a furnace with an AFUE rating of 90+% will be more expensive to purchase than one with an 80% AFUE rating.<\/p>\n<p>If you live in an area with harsh and long winters or you own a particularly large home, you\u2019ll probably make up for that higher installation cost with the monthly savings you\u2019ll accrue on your heating bills. However, if you\u2019re not going to be using your heating system that rigorously, you won\u2019t be saving nearly as much each month. After all, an 80% AFUE furnace is still pretty efficient and will get the job done with lower upfront costs.<\/p>\n<h2>Forced Air Heating<\/h2>\n<p>Forced air heating is another option that\u2019s growing in popularity these days in the area. These systems can be installed as part of a central heating and cooling system and will provide heated air to the various parts of your home through a series of ducts. An air handler manages the flow of air through the ducts to make sure that all areas of your home receive an equal amount of heating.<\/p>\n<p>Forced air heating systems can run on either gas or electricity and they are also generally more energy efficient than either gas or electric furnaces. They\u2019re a great option particularly for those living in area with mild winters, but they can have trouble keeping up with the heating load in harsher climates.<\/p>\n<p>No matter what type of heating system you\u2019re leaning towards, we have what you need. So <a href=\"tel:410-355-6010\">give us a call today<\/a>.
