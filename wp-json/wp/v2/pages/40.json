But did you know that there could very well be even more in the air trapped inside your home? In fact government agencies from around the globe have named indoor air pollution as one of the major health risks we all face today. There are many reasons why your indoor air quality may be compromised, but there is something you can do about it.<\/p>\n<h2>Providing Indoor Air Quality Baltimore MD and surrounding areas.<\/h2>\n<p>If you live in the Baltimore, investing in one of the many indoor air purification systems is critical. Cooling carries is a great way to start improving the quality of the air your family is breathing in every day. You may not have noticed that the quality of your indoor air was poor to begin with, but you\u2019re sure to notice the difference when you have one of these systems in place to improve it.<\/p>\n<h2>Air Ventilation<\/h2>\n<p>How did the quality of the air inside your home get so bad to begin with? Well, one of the main reasons that indoor air quality has begun to become such a big problem in recent years is that fact that modern homes are sealed up so tight to maximize energy efficiency of heating and air conditioning systems. With the proliferation of year round temperature control systems, people no longer have a need to open windows to let in fresh air.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it\u2019s in our best financial interests not to have any fresh air coming into the house at all. After all, we\u2019re paying to maintain the comfortable indoor environment and we don\u2019t want to let all of that temperature controlled air escape.<\/p>\n<p>What that means, though, is that these sealed indoor environments that we\u2019ve created also keep all sorts of air contaminants sealed in. Without anywhere else to go, these particles continue to circulate throughout the house, causing all sorts of breathing problems and allergic reactions. They could be anything from smoke odors and gasses to pollen and pet dander. Whatever they are, you need to find a way to get rid of them.<\/p>\n<h2>Eliminating Particles &amp; Cleaning Your Air<\/h2>\n<p>Luckily, there are now many options for cleaning the air inside our homes. Quite a few different particle trapping technologies have been developed in the last few years precisely for this reason, and depending on the types of particulate contaminants you\u2019re having trouble with, you can select a system that will help to remedy your situation.<\/p>\n<p>These technologies include mechanical air filters, ionization devices and even UV germicidal lights that can kill any bacteria or viruses that pass by them. Each of these devices has their own strengths and weaknesses. For instance, mechanical devices like HEPA filters are extremely effective at trapping particles that measure 0.3 microns or larger.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, ionizers are more adept at picking out the smaller particles, but can have a harder time with the larger ones. And UV lights are not able to remove any particles at all, but they still serve a very important purpose because of their ability to kill the germs that could make your family sick.<\/p>\n<h2>Indoor Air Quality Products &amp; Services<\/h2>\n<p>If you think it\u2019s time to invest in one of these great indoor air quality systems, give us a <a href=\"tel:410-355-6010\">call today<\/a>.
